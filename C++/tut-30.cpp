// STL --> standard template library
/*
In C++ if we have to sort, resize, search an array have to perform any 
other operation on any other problem we can either start from scratch and 
use/reuse our own code or use the code from standard template library
which include some generic class and function.
Using STL have its own advantage we are using well tested components.
Components of STL are:
    1. Containers: stores data. there are 3 types of container:
        a. sequence container : stores in sequence
        b. associatative container : direct access example set/multiset
        c. derived container : derived from sequence cont. example stack,queue
    2. Algorithms: set of procedures to manipulate data to get 
           desired result. there can be millions of algo example
        a. sorting
        b. searching
        c. face detection
    3. Iterators: is an object which points to an element in a container 
                  (like pointer) connects algorithms with container.
